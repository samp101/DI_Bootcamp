// "534"
//  






// really the sheet will stop after 2 because its an error

// 5 + "34" = 534 as a text with Conntation
// 5 - "4" = error because 5 is an integer and 4 is a string
// 10 % 5 = 2
// 5 % 10 = .5
// "Java" + "Script" = "JavaScript" because it connataion the text even the + is meant to be with and integer
// " " + " " = "  "
// " " + 0 = " 0"
// true + true = 2 because true also has a set value as 1 so 1+1 = 2
// true + false = 1 
// false + true = 1
// false - true = - 1
// 3 - 4 = -1
// "Bob" - "bill" = error the logic being since they arent integers it cant conntoniate it and will return an error 

// really the sheet will stop after 2 because its an error

// 5 + "34" = 534 as a text with Conntation
// 5 - "4" = its really 1 because although 4 is a text it will conjugate it.
// 10 % 5 = 2 this is really 0 because % is the remainder so 5 goes into 10 twice with 0 remainder
// 5 % 10 = .5 the answer really is 5 not sure why
